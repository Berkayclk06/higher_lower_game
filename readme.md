<h1>Higher Lower Game</h1>
<hr style="height:5px">
To run the program, installing Flask to the system is needed.

After installation, run the program and go to the url.

Flask will give you an url, generally:

```commandline
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

To play the game, you must enter a number after the slash in url.

Eg.

```commandline
http://127.0.0.1:5000/2
```
Have fun !
